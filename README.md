# Re:Claim

Re:Claim is a web-based lost and found tracking system for West Visayas State University (WVSU) students, college student councils, and the University Student Council (USC).

The objectives of this project are as follows:

- **To centralize the reporting and tracking of lost and found items** by developing a web-based system that accepts lost and found items as input and can be marked recovered when confirmed.
- **To increase awareness and accessibility of where to report lost and found items** by promoting the web-based system on face-to-face and social media channels.
- **To increase awareness of where to recover lost and found items** should they be confirmed.
